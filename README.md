# Web-Scraping-Challenge

# Introduction
The challenge is to develop a web scraping tool for gathering information for a "Mission to Mars." The web scraping uses a Flask application with Python and MongoDB

# Resources
* https://redplanetscience.com/
* https://spaceimages-mars.com/
* https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/
* https://marshemispheres.com/

# Methodology
The scrape: finds the most recent news article and returns it with a brief description; finds the "featured" mars image and returns it; crapes a table of mars facts; and returns four images, one for each of Mar's four hemispheres.  There is a "Get Data!" button  at the top to refresh this with the latest info.
